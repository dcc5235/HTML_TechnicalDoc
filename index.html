  <h1>This is my first project.</h1>
  <h2>Can you tell it is a test site?</h2>
  <p>I am excited to utilize this project to test my knowledge base on
    HTML.</p>
  <p>So far, I have learned about Text Editors like Visual Studio Code.
    Text editors are essentially programs that
    allow us to write code. HTML (hypertext markup language) is one
    language that allows us to see text on a site.
    It basically consists of the title, head, and body with closing
    tags.</p>
  <p>One key element to development is learning how to problem solve.
    Developers cannot memorize everything they
    learn, so there are plenty of shortcuts and <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> can be a powerful
    tool. However, it is still important that they understand the
    foundation of
    what they do. For example, developers should know that a !Doctype
    HTML tag is a declaration that tells the
    browser what type of code language is being used, so that the server
    can portray this text or visual to the
    user. It is also important for developers to understand the
    foundation of coding languages, because language is
    not fixed. HTML has now evolved to HTML5.</p>
  <p>Some additional things to know: there are approximately 10-15 HTML
    tags that are used which include: h tags
    (header), p tags(paragraph), ol tags (ordered list), li tags (list
    items), etc... A block of content with the
    tag are
    considered elements.</p>
  <p>An ordered list tag or ol tag allows you to create a numerical text
    list. For example, a list of fruits to buy:
  <ol>
    <li>apples</li>
    <li>oranges</li>
    <li>pears</li>
  </ol>
  An unordered list tag or ul tag allows you to create bullet points
  without the numerical text list. For examples, a
  list of why you love fruit:
  <ul>
    <li>healthy</li>
    <li>tasty</li>
    <li>full of fiber and vitamins</li>
  </ul>
  Regardless of the type of tags you utilize here, we are essentially
  nesting child tags within a parent one (e.g. ul
  tag (child) is nested with the p tag(parent)). You can even nest
  lists within lists. For example, a list of types of
  apples within your list of fruits to buy:
  <ol>
    <li>apples</li>
    <ul>
      <li>fuji</li>
      <li>granny smith</li>
      <li>macintosh</li>
    </ul>
    <li>oranges</li>
    <li>pears</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>Not all tags require a closing tag. There are some self-closing tags
    like ones used for page breaks or images.
    Some self closing tags also have <em>attributes</em> which creates a
    special property to that tag. An attribute
    always has a <strong>value</strong> attached to it. If we used the
    fruit list above and wanted to add an image
    here. We would
    utilize the self-closing tag for images to do so.<br><img
      src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQP3jsY5kRhbw6--r8Mfs_iM1pwgaaXgAaD2w&usqp=CAU"
      alt="fuji apple" width="42" height="42"><br>An image tag
    typically includes 2 attributes (alt and src). The
    alt attribute is an alternate text for the image for screen readers.
    The src attribute is the source of the
    image.<br> Another self closing tag that is often used is the input
    tag for the parent form tag. For example, a
    text box that users can use to submit their favorite fruit, can be
    created like the one below.<br>
  <form>Favorite fruit <input type="text" required><br><input type="submit" value="Tell me!">
    <input type="reset"></form><br>We can even go as far as to
  submit a form for the date in which you last consumed
  your favorite fruit or buttons to choose from various fruits, such
  as the ones below.<br>
  <form><input type="date"><br>
    Your favorite fruits:<br>
    <input type="radio" name="fruit"> Pineapple<br><input type="radio" name="fruit"> Lychee<br> <input type="radio"
      name="fruit"> Rambutan<br><input type="submit"><br>
    The best time of day to eat fruit:<br>
    <input type="checkbox"> Morning<br><input type="checkbox"> Noon<br><input type="checkbox"> Evening<br><input
      type="submit"><br>
  </form><br>Let's take this one step further. Let's add a drop down
  menu so that others can choose best countries for
  buying fruit.<br>
  <form>
    Best countries for buying fruit:<br>
    <select type="select">
      <option value="United States">United States </option>
      <option value="Philippines">Philippines </option>
      <option value="Brazil">Brazil </option>

    </select><br>
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>Anchor tags (a tag) has an href attribute and value that includes a
    link to texts or images of a separate file.
    This is essentially how you can link other web pages to the current
    site.<br>
    <a href="form.html" target="_blank">Fill out our form!</a> </p>
</body>
<p>Now, onto Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The basics for CSS code is the
  selector {<br>Property:
  value;<br>}<br>
  The order of CSS rules matter since it is a cascading language. Add a class
  attribute to tags to change your styles for like elements. </p>

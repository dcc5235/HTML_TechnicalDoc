  User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
  
  User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
  
  User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user. -->



What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

The
<!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The

<head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
  The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the
    page's tab)
    The

<body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings,
  paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
  The <h1> element defines a large heading
    The <p> element defines a paragraph
      </section>
    <section class="main-section">

      What is an HTML Element?
      An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

      <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
      The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

      <h1>My First Heading</h1>
      <p>My first paragraph.</p>
      <p>One key element to development is learning how to problem solve.
        Developers cannot memorize everything they
        learn, so there are plenty of shortcuts and <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> can be a powerful
        tool. However, it is still important that they understand the
        foundation of
        what they do. For example, developers should know that a !Doctype
        HTML tag is a declaration that tells the
        browser what type of code language is being used, so that the server
        can portray this text or visual to the
        user. It is also important for developers to understand the
        foundation of coding languages, because language is
        not fixed. HTML has now evolved to HTML5.</p>
      <p>Some additional things to know: there are approximately 10-15 HTML
        tags that are used which include: h tags
        (header), p tags(paragraph), ol tags (ordered list), li tags (list
        items), etc... A block of content with the
        tag are
        considered elements.</p>

      HTML Editors
      Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.<p>So far, I have learned about Text
        Editors like Visual Studio Code.
        Text editors are essentially programs that
        allow us to write code. HTML (hypertext markup language) is one
        language that allows us to see text on a site.
        It basically consists of the title, head, and body with closing
        tags.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
      HTML lists
      <p>An ordered list tag or ol tag allows you to create a numerical text
        list. For example, a list of fruits to buy:
      <ol>
        <li>apples</li>
        <li>oranges</li>
        <li>pears</li>
      </ol>
      An unordered list tag or ul tag allows you to create bullet points
      without the numerical text list. For examples, a
      list of why you love fruit:
      <ul>
        <li>healthy</li>
        <li>tasty</li>
        <li>full of fiber and vitamins</li>
      </ul>
      Regardless of the type of tags you utilize here, we are essentially
      nesting child tags within a parent one (e.g. ul
      tag (child) is nested with the p tag(parent)). You can even nest
      lists within lists. For example, a list of types of
      apples within your list of fruits to buy:
      <ol>
        <li>apples</li>
        <ul>
          <li>fuji</li>
          <li>granny smith</li>
          <li>macintosh</li>
        </ul>
        <li>oranges</li>
        <li>pears</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

    <section class="main-section">Self Closing tags
      <p>Not all tags require a closing tag. There are some self-closing tags
        like ones used for page breaks or images.
        Some self closing tags also have <em>attributes</em> which creates a
        special property to that tag. An attribute
        always has a <strong>value</strong> attached to it. If we used the
        fruit list above and wanted to add an image
        here. We would
        utilize the self-closing tag for images to do so.<br><img
          src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQP3jsY5kRhbw6--r8Mfs_iM1pwgaaXgAaD2w&usqp=CAU"
          alt="fuji apple" width="42" height="42"><br>An image tag
        typically includes 2 attributes (alt and src). The
        alt attribute is an alternate text for the image for screen readers.
        The src attribute is the source of the
        image.<br> Another self closing tag that is often used is the input
        tag for the parent form tag. For example, a
        text box that users can use to submit their favorite fruit, can be
        created like the one below.<br>
      <form>Favorite fruit <input type="text" required><br><input type="submit" value="Tell me!">
        <input type="reset"></form><br>We can even go as far as to
      submit a form for the date in which you last consumed
      your favorite fruit or buttons to choose from various fruits, such
      as the ones below.<br>
      <form><input type="date"><br>
        Your favorite fruits:<br>
        <input type="radio" name="fruit"> Pineapple<br><input type="radio" name="fruit"> Lychee<br> <input type="radio"
          name="fruit"> Rambutan<br><input type="submit"><br>
        The best time of day to eat fruit:<br>
        <input type="checkbox"> Morning<br><input type="checkbox"> Noon<br><input type="checkbox"> Evening<br><input
          type="submit"><br>
      </form><br>Let's take this one step further. Let's add a drop down
      menu so that others can choose best countries for
      buying fruit.<br>
      <form>
        Best countries for buying fruit:<br>
        <select type="select">
          <option value="United States">United States </option>
          <option value="Philippines">Philippines </option>
          <option value="Brazil">Brazil </option>

        </select><br>
        <input type="submit">
      </form>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Anchor tags (a tag) has an href attribute and value that includes a
        link to texts or images of a separate file.
        This is essentially how you can link other web pages to the current
        site.<br>
        <a href="form.html" target="_blank">Fill out our form!</a> </p>
